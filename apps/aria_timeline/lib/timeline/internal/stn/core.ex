  Main STN (Simple Temporal Network) interface module.

  This module provides a clean delegation API to the split STN modules:
  - Operations: Core interval and constraint management
  - Consistency: Validation and classification
  - Scheduling: Interval queries and scheduling operations

  All functionality is preserved through delegation while maintaining
  backward compatibility with existing code.
